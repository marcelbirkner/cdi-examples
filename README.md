This repository contains several Maven projects that are
used in a couple of Java Magazin articles in 2011. The 
projects contain examples for using CDI (JSR299) as well as
how to test Java EE applications using Mockito and Arquillian.

Each project contains a README file with information on
how to run the source code. Have fun with the examples :-)
